#Joke List
================

##A collection of jokes in Go!

Getting Started
To run the joke list, simply compile and run the main.go file. The program will randomly select a joke from the list and print it to the console.

####Adding Jokes
To add more jokes to the list, simply add a new string to the jokes slice in the main.go file. For example

jokes := []string{
    // existing jokes...
    "Why did the kid bring a ladder to school? He wanted to reach his full potential!",
    "What do you call a fish with no eyes? A fsh!",
    // add your new joke here!
    "Why did the [insert joke here]? Because [insert punchline here]!",
}
Customizing the Joke List
You can customize the joke list to fit your needs. Want to add more jokes? Simply add them to the jokes slice. Want to remove jokes? Just delete them from the slice.

Running the Program
To run the program, navigate to the directory containing the main.go file and run the following command:


go run main.go
This will compile and run the program, printing a random joke to the console.
